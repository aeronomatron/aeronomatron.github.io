# Nightswan's (aeronomatron) Art Archive!
## Overview
This is an archive of most of the artwork I have done. It doesn't include things from before 2020, as those aren't a good representation of my skill right now, with the latest pieces being from early 2020. I intend to use this as a portfolio, and potentially a commission example page. 

The page also demonstrates some of my knowledge in site building and Javascript. It has a few little JS functions built in, and I may look at adding more interactivity in the future.

## Graphics
For each of the clients, I've created some Twitch graphics for them as commissions. Generally, emotes are very small and difficult to see intricate details on, so I have to transform their mascots into still distinctly-recognizeable but also very simplified versions for these emotes. For other graphics (banners, panels) I try to keep close to the original design given to me.

## Landscape/Environment Paintings
These are full renders of scenes that may or may not contain some living subjects, but overall it focuses on the environment rather than the subject. I feel the most comfortable creating natural scenes (forests, caves, etc.) but am flexible, and I am sure I can get a grasp on things like cityscapes if I do a few studies. 

## Portraits
I can also do work focused on a specific subject (headshot, bodyshot etc.) and display my skills to do so here. These can also be artworks that aren't fully rendered/painted, as I have a small variation of styles I use. 

## Character Designs
I work as a designer for the Instagram account ufogs.species and most of my designs shown in this section are custom drawn to be sold on the account. There are also miscellaneous designs for other species accounts and a few of my older human designs. I have no recent finished designs but I recently began working on humans, with more examples in Sketches.

## Sketches and WIPs
These are sketches that I am not sure will be finished, but provide some baselines to things that I may not have demonstrated in the previous sections (e.g. drawing humans.) Most of my sketches do not end up finished anyways, so posting some will show my more recent experimentation and projects that I haven't finished yet.

## Cat Generator
Just a fun little demonstration of a bit of my JavaScript knowledge.
