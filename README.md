# Nightswan's (aeronomatron) Art Archive!
## Overview
This is an archive of most of the artwork I have done. It doesn't include things from before 2020, as those aren't a good representation of my skill right now, with the latest pieces being from early 2020. I intend to use this as a portfolio, and potentially a commission example page. 

The page also demonstrates some of my knowledge in site building and Javascript. It has a few little JS functions built in, and I may look at adding more interactivity in the future.
